okay, thanks, in that case, i would like you to write a script which follows the bellow structure

word_permutations()
    #generating all the permutations of the word

split the dataframe, to two, one for english and one for danish


dataframe updater(dataframe_a, dataframe_b)
    for line in dataframe_a:
        correct_spellings = dataframe.correct_spellings 
         find word permutations
        new_words = []
        for each word permutation:
            check if word in correct_spelings
    create a list for all correct spellings
