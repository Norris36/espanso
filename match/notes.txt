:```
import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()
copenhagen_time = now + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)

print(copenhagen_time.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))
```
This script imports the datetime module and uses it to get the current time. It then adds one hour to account for the time difference between Denmark and UTC, and prints the time in the format of hours, minutes, and seconds.
