Dear Mike,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to introduce you to Amanda, our relocation agent. She will be assisting me with my upcoming move and I wanted to ensure that we are all on the same page.

As you know, my apartment is currently being paid for by the company. I would appreciate it if you could coordinate with Amanda to ensure that this continues to be the case during and after my move.

Amanda will be in touch with you shortly to discuss the details further. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Det her er en kedelig email. 

Du har måske hørt fra Eleni og/eller Luyao, lige nu er jeg i hvert fald sat i mindre god situation. 

Turen til Chicago har ellers gået rigtig godt, alt har mere eller mindre gået flyvende fra jeg fik mit visa.

Lige nu står jeg og får ikke udbetalt løn i maj. 
Efter amerikansk lov, skal man have et sygesikringskort for at få udbetalt løn, og det går der minimum 2 uger før, hvis ikke 4, og derfra tager det yderligere to uger for payroll at kan udbetale pengene. Så det er meget sandsynligt, at jeg ikke får udbetalt løn midt/slut juni. 

Mike er i gange med at koordinere med Deanna, så vidt jeg ved

Mike og Travis er meget engageret i at hjælpe, med at købe ind og få det her  til at fungere, men i sidste ende er det en seriøs streg i regningen for den her oplevelse.","[Email], [Eleni], [Luyao], [Chicago], [visa], [løn], [amerikansk lov], [sygesikringskort], [2 uger], [4 uger], [payroll], [pengene], [Mike], [Deanna], [Travis], [købe ind], [seriøs streg i regningen], [oplevelse].",1684976667

def add_string_to_yaml_file(file_path, string_to_add):
    with open(file_path, 'a') as file:
        yaml.dump(string_to_add, file)
```

This function takes two arguments: `file_path` is the path to the YAML file you want to add the string to, and `string_to_add` is the string you want to add. 

The function opens the file in append mode (`'a'`), which means it will add the string to the end of the file. It then uses the `yaml.dump()` function to write the string to the file in YAML format. 

Note that this function assumes that the YAML file already exists and has valid YAML content. If the file doesn't exist or has invalid YAML content, this function may not work as expected.",1684977500

Focus Session: Honeing in on Data Principles,"To hone in on data principles, it is important to first establish a clear understanding of what data is and how it is used. Data can be defined as any information that can be collected, stored, and analyzed to gain insights and make informed decisions.

Some key principles to keep in mind when working with data include accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. It is important to ensure that data is accurate and reliable, and that it is complete and consistent across all sources. Timeliness is also critical, as outdated or delayed data can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

Another important principle is data privacy and security. It is essential to protect sensitive data and ensure that it is only accessed by authorized individuals. This includes implementing appropriate security measures, such as encryption and access controls, and complying with relevant regulations and standards.

Finally, it is important to approach data with a critical mindset, recognizing that data can be biased or incomplete. It is important to carefully evaluate data sources and methodologies, and to consider multiple perspectives when analyzing data to ensure that decisions are based on accurate and unbiased information.",1686020177
"PLease convert this transcription to a paragraph which could be in a book
In the following series of videos, we'll give a formal treatment of asymptotic
notation, in particular big-Oh notation, as well as work through a number of examples.
Big-Oh notation concerns functions defined on the positive integers, we'll call it T(n)
We'll pretty much always have the same semantics for T(n). We're gonna be
concerned about the worst-case running time of an algorithm, as a function of the
input size, n. So, the question I wanna answer for you in the rest of this video,
is, what does it mean when we say a function, T(n), is big-Oh of f(n). Or
hear f(n) is some basic function, like for example n log n. So I'll give you a
number of answers, a number of ways of, to think about what big-Oh notation really
means. For starters let's begin with an English definition. What does it mean for
a function to be big-Oh of f(n)? It means eventually, for all sufficiently large
values of n, it's bounded above by a constant multiple of f(n). Let's think
about it in a couple other ways. So next I'm gonna translate this English
definition into picture and then I'll translate it into formal mathematics. So
pictorially you can imagine that perhaps we have T(n) denoted by this blue
functions here. And perhaps f(n) is denoted by this green function here, which
lies below T(n). But when we double f(n), we get a function that eventually
crosses T(n) and forevermore is larger than it. So in this event, we would say
that T(n) indeed is a Big-Oh of f(n). The reason being that for all sufficiently
large n, and once we go far enough out right on this graph, indeed, a constant
multiple times of f(n), twice f(n), is an upper bound of T(n).
So finally, let me give you a actual mathematical definition that you could use
to do formal proofs. So how do we say, in mathematics, that eventually it should be
bounded above by a constant multiple of f(n)? We see that there exists two
constants, which I'll call c and n0. So that T(n) is no more than c times f(n)
for all n that exceed or equal n0. So, the role of these two constants is to
quantify what we mean by a constant multiple, and what we mean by sufficiently
large, in the English definition. c obviously quantifies the constant multiple
of f(n), and n0 is quantifying sufficiently large, that's the threshold
beyond which we insist that, c times f(n) is an upper-bound on T(n). So, going
back to the picture, what are c and n0? Well, c, of course, is just going to
be two. And n0 is the crossing point. So we get to where two f(n). And T(n)
cross, and then we drop the acentode. This would be the relative value of n0
in this picture, so that's the formal definition, the way to prove that
something's bigger of f(n) you exhibit these two constants c and n0
and it better be the case that for all n at least n0, c times f(n) upper-bounds T(n).
One way to think about it if you're trying to establish that something is big-Oh of
some function it's like you're playing a game against an opponent and you want to
prove that. This inequality here holds and your opponent must show that it doesn't
hold for sufficiently large n you have to go first your job is to pick a strategy in
the form of a constant c and a constant n0 and your opponent is then allowed to
pick any number n larger than n0 so the function is big-Oh of f(n) if and only if you
have a winning strategy in this game. If you can up front commit to constants c and
n0 so that no matter how big of an n your opponent picks, this inequality holds
if you have no winning strategy then it's not big-Oh of f(n) no matter what C and n0
you choose your opponent can always flip this in equality. By choosing a
suitable, suitable large value of n. I want to emphasis one last thing which is
that these constants, what do I mean by constants. I mean they are independent of
n. And so when you apply this definition, and you choose your constant c and
n0, it better be that n does not appear anywhere. So C should just be something
like a thousand or a million. Some constant independent of n. So those are a
bunch of way to think about big-Oh notation. In English, you wanna have it
bound above for sufficiently large numbers n. I'm showing you how to translate that
into mathematics that give you a pictorial representation. And also sort of a game
theoretic way to think about it. Now, let's move on to a video that explores a
number of examples.","The concept of asymptotic notation, specifically big-Oh notation, is explored in a series of videos. The focus is on functions defined on positive integers, denoted as T(n), and their worst-case running time as a function of input size, n. The question addressed is what it means for a function to be big-Oh of f(n), where f(n) is a basic function such as n log n. The English definition of big-Oh notation is that eventually, for all sufficiently large values of n, T(n) is bounded above by a constant multiple of f(n). This is translated into a pictorial representation and a formal mathematical definition, which requires two constants, c and n0, to quantify the constant multiple and sufficiently large values of n, respectively. The constants must be independent of n. The video concludes with a game-theoretic way to think about establishing big-Oh notation and a promise to explore examples in the next video.",1686192059

write me a poem,"In the stillness of the night,
When the world is dark and quiet,
My thoughts take flight,
And my heart feels light.

The stars above twinkle bright,
As I ponder life's great height,
And all the wonders in sight,
That make my heart ignite.

The moon's soft glow,
Casts a peaceful shadow,
As I let my mind flow,
And my spirit grow.

In this moment of calm,
I find my inner balm,
And feel the world's charm,
In a simple, soothing psalm.

So let the night embrace,
And let your soul find its place,
In this peaceful, sacred space,
Where love and light interlace.",1686689262

They are often used on social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram, where brevity is key. However, it is important to remember that sometimes a little context can go a long way. For example, simply saying ""Don't chug an expensive wine"" may not be enough to convince someone to savor their drink. Providing a brief explanation of why it's important to take your time with a nice bottle of wine, such as the complex flavors and aromas that can be missed when consumed too quickly, can help drive the point home.",1686778588

However, it's important to remember that just like with an expensive wine, you shouldn't chug through your code and hastily add comments without thought or consideration. Take the time to carefully craft your comments, ensuring they are clear, concise, and add value to your codebase.

  By including this snippet, we ensure that any calls to segment functions (e.g.
  analytics.track()) won't throw an error, even if we haven't set a write key.

  It is the actual analytics.load() call which loads the javascript from segment.

  This is going to get a little wild. Segment analytics.js does not support global
  IP setting or anonymization, but we need it for GDPR compliance. So what we do here
  is basically monkeypatch the analytics.js library.

  The problem with monkeypatching is that everything that gets put in the analytics queue
  will run before the monkeypatching can be done. So, in order to make sure that *every*
  call has IP hardcoded, we override the analytics queue functions created by the
  snippet.","This documentation explains how to ensure that calls to segment functions won't throw an error, even if a write key hasn't been set. The analytics.load() call loads the javascript from segment. 

However, there is an issue with GDPR compliance because Segment analytics.js does not support global IP setting or anonymization. To solve this problem, the library is monkeypatched. Monkeypatching means that the code is modified at runtime, which can be risky because everything that gets put in the analytics queue will run before the monkeypatching can be done. 

To ensure that every call has IP hardcoded, the analytics queue functions created by the snippet are overridden. This ensures that the code is GDPR compliant and that the IP is hardcoded for every call.",1686875797

Account Updated
---------------

This event is sent when a user updates their account. This happens from the profile section of the dashboard. The :ref:`segment-users` information will be updated accordingly.

This event has no properties.


Account Verified
----------------

This event is sent when a user verifies their email. It can happen either as part of the registration process, or it could be a user that was created before we required this, or it can also happen as part of the password reset process.

Once the user has verified their email, their profile will be updated to reflect it (``is_verified`` will be ``true``)

This event does not have any properties.


Password Changed
