Dear Mike,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to introduce you to Amanda, our relocation agent. She will be assisting me with my upcoming move and I wanted to ensure that we are all on the same page.

As you know, my apartment is currently being paid for by the company. I would appreciate it if you could coordinate with Amanda to ensure that this continues to be the case during and after my move.

Amanda will be in touch with you shortly to discuss the details further. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Det her er en kedelig email. 

Du har måske hørt fra Eleni og/eller Luyao, lige nu er jeg i hvert fald sat i mindre god situation. 

Turen til Chicago har ellers gået rigtig godt, alt har mere eller mindre gået flyvende fra jeg fik mit visa.

Lige nu står jeg og får ikke udbetalt løn i maj. 
Efter amerikansk lov, skal man have et sygesikringskort for at få udbetalt løn, og det går der minimum 2 uger før, hvis ikke 4, og derfra tager det yderligere to uger for payroll at kan udbetale pengene. Så det er meget sandsynligt, at jeg ikke får udbetalt løn midt/slut juni. 

Mike er i gange med at koordinere med Deanna, så vidt jeg ved

Mike og Travis er meget engageret i at hjælpe, med at købe ind og få det her  til at fungere, men i sidste ende er det en seriøs streg i regningen for den her oplevelse.","[Email], [Eleni], [Luyao], [Chicago], [visa], [løn], [amerikansk lov], [sygesikringskort], [2 uger], [4 uger], [payroll], [pengene], [Mike], [Deanna], [Travis], [købe ind], [seriøs streg i regningen], [oplevelse].",1684976667

def add_string_to_yaml_file(file_path, string_to_add):
    with open(file_path, 'a') as file:
        yaml.dump(string_to_add, file)
```

This function takes two arguments: `file_path` is the path to the YAML file you want to add the string to, and `string_to_add` is the string you want to add. 

The function opens the file in append mode (`'a'`), which means it will add the string to the end of the file. It then uses the `yaml.dump()` function to write the string to the file in YAML format. 

Note that this function assumes that the YAML file already exists and has valid YAML content. If the file doesn't exist or has invalid YAML content, this function may not work as expected.",1684977500
