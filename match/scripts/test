 :When a user tries to apply a coupon code at checkout, the "cartView" function in the cart.py file is called. If the coupon is invalid, the "send_robust" function is triggered in the signals.py file, which then calls the "segment track" function. This function sends the data to the database under the COUPON_DENIED event. The data flows from the front end to the cartView function, then to the signals.py file, and finally to the database where it is stored for future use.
